# NFT-project-nextjs-etherjs-merkletree-whitelist-mint

## About this project
This project is part of the training program offered by the blockchain school Alyra. It was created to help students learn how to build NFT minting sites using Next.js, Ether.js, Merkle Tree, and Whitelist Minting.

The project was developed under the guidance of our instructor BenBK, who provided us with valuable feedback and support throughout the project.

## How the project works
Our project uses Next.js to provide a web interface for users. With Ether.js, we interact with the Ethereum blockchain to store information about the NFTs created. We also use Merkle Tree to create a whitelist of users authorized to create NFTs, ensuring that only authorized users can create NFTs.

## Prerequisites
Before you can use the project, you must have the following tools installed on your local machine:

```Node.js
NPM or Yarn
```
## How to use the project

* Install all dependencies by running npm install or yarn install in your terminal.
* Create a .env file at the root of the project and add your Ethereum API keys (ETHERSCAN_API_KEY) and Infura (INFURA_PROJECT_ID) keys
* Configure the Merkle Tree settings in the utils/merkleTree.js file
* Add the Ethereum addresses of authorized users to create NFTs in the utils/whitelist.js file
* Run the project by running npm run dev or yarn dev in your terminal.
